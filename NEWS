History of Nife releases :

2022-01-04 - Nife 0.61 is released.
	* Added a definition of HUGE for compilers that no longer have it in
	  math.h. Thanks to Jacques Godfrain Kounkou for his bug report !
	* Added some "include" where it was missing.

2019-01-27 - Nife 0.60 is released.
	* Updated headers to show that the project is still alive !
	* The Nife official site is now : https://www.seriane.org/nife/

2016-08-15 - Nife 0.59 is released.
	* Add implementation of data meta-stacks tools for context swapping :
	  [ and ] for respectively increment and decrement the numerical stack,
	  { and } to do theses operations with the character stack,
	  ( and ) to do the same thing with the logical stack,
	  and [* and ]* to operate on the three stacks.
	* Fixed a bug causing an error with network functions netDt> and NetKey.
	* The Nife official site is now : http://www.nifesys.org.

2015-08-10 - Nife 0.55 is released.
	* Changing the log file contents to be able to use it for debugging.
	  The log file is in the subdirectory .nife. His name is the type
	  .nife_PID.log, PID being its number of pid.
	  We can display the content in real time with tail -f.
	  The .nifeNS_pid.log and .nifeRPC_PID.log files are those of the
	  server networks and its bodies.
	  Log files are deleted at the end of the Nife session unless an error
	  occured.
	* Added "savelog function to save the logs before going out.
	* Placing aid debugging functions. All these functions begin with the _
 	  character and are listed with ?libp function.
	* Added shell script command, ex/NifeDebugTerms, to facilitate
	  establishment and closing of the display terminals for the logs.
	* Added the possibility, in graphic mode, to open or close
	  terminals with keys 'home' and 'end'. These functionalities are
	  based on performance in the window manager of the above script.
	* Reorganization of system functions in the function stack.
	* Improved tasks and consoles.
	* Added the ability to execute external command interactively, with the
	  character ! at the beginning of the line.

2014-08-31 - Nife 0.51 is released.
	* Finalising the version 1.0 of the functions dump and restore with the
	  definition of the NBLF, Nife Binary Linkable Format.
	* Modify some labels to clarify the perception of internal mechanisms.
	* Some modifications to avoid unnecessary warnings at compilation.
	* Temporary suspension of some functions related to the dynamic aspect
	  of the language because, used improperly, it could be dangerous.
	  These functions will be include again, but with more explanations and
	  examples.

2014-06-27 - Nife 0.49 is released.
	* Add DEC, HEX, OCT and BIN functions to define the print mode for the
	  integers. The default is decimal.
	* Modify signals comportment to accept interrupt from terminal to stop
	  execution in the main (interactive) task.
	* Fixed an error in the case of the end: label is before the onerr: one.
	* Fixed a bug when a signal "segmentation violation" is catched.
	* Add some help facilities suggested by Alain Empain, until his tools
	  are efficient in Nife.
	* Beginning the functions dump and restore with definition of the NBLF,
	  Nife Binary Linkable Format (just for a Request for Comments ;-).

	  with his students Elodie Kerfourn and Aymeric Diankouika. They
	  connected a Raspberry Pi with an Arduino board through the I2C bus
	  and wrote a Nife program to highlight the data exchange between the
	  two elements.
	* The installation has been tested by Bernard Bonno on a Raspberry Pi
	  board Model A with Porteus ARM (based on a Slackware ARM 14.0).

2013-09-25 - Nife 0.44 is released.

	  of the Nife code on some systems as Raspberry Pi A and B and others.
	  This bug was reported by Bernard Bonno during tests on a Raspberry Pi
	  Model A with 256 Mo of memory.
